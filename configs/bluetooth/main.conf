# Permanently enables the Fast Connectable setting for adapters that
# support it. When enabled other devices can connect faster to us,
# however the tradeoff is increased power consumptions. This feature
# will fully work only on kernel version 4.1 and newer. Defaults to
# 'false'.
# 📢 Non default value 📢

# How long to keep temporary devices around
# The value is in seconds. Default is 30.
# 0 = disable timer, i.e. never keep temporary devices
# ✅ Use default

# The following values are used to load default adapter parameters.  BlueZ loads
# the values into the kernel before the adapter is powered if the kernel
# supports the MGMT_LOAD_DEFAULT_PARAMETERS command. If a value isn't provided,
# the kernel will be initialized to it's default value.  The actual value will
# vary based on the kernel version and thus aren't provided here.
# The Bluetooth Core Specification should be consulted for the meaning and valid
# domain of each of these values.

[GATT]
# GATT attribute cache.
# Possible values:
# always: Always cache attributes even for devices not paired, this is
# recommended as it is best for interoperability, with more consistent
# reconnection times and enables proper tracking of notifications for all
# devices.
# yes: Only cache attributes of paired devices.
# no: Never cache attributes
# Default: always
# ✅ Use default
Cache = always

# Minimum required Encryption Key Size for accessing secured characteristics.
# Possible values: 0 and 7-16. 0 means don't care.
# Defaults to 0
# ✅ Use default

# Exchange MTU size.

# Number of ATT channels
# Possible values: 1-5 (1 disables EATT)
# Default to 3
# 🧨 Non default value 🧨
# 📢 By only allowing one channel the extended attribute protocol (EATT) is disabled. 📢

# transmission over GATT characteristics more difficult.

# The ReconnectUUIDs defines the set of remote services that should try

# empty the reconnection feature gets disabled.
# 🧨 Non default value 🧨

# lost. Setting the value to 0 disables reconnecting feature.
# 📢 Take effect only when ReconnectUUIDs is not an empty list 📢
# 🧨 Non default value 🧨

# ReconnectIntervals define the set of intervals in seconds to use in between
# attempts.
# If the number of attempts defined in ReconnectAttempts is bigger than the
# set of intervals the last interval is repeated until the last attempt.
